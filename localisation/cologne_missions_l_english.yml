 frog_flavor_kol.EVTNAME1: "How radical of a reformation?"
 frog_flavor_kol.EVTOPTA1: "Did Jesus not say "It is easier for a cammel to enter through the eye of a needle than a rich person to enter heaven"?"
 frog_flavor_kol.EVTOPTB1: "Let's not get ahead of yourselves here"
 frog_flavor_kol.EVTDESC1: "Our reformation movement has picked up steam in the last couple years, primarily among the peasantry. While this is good and all, many peasants have now started to take up arms against the feudal order in order to purify the social relationships. They claim that faith is a personal endevour and as such cannot be forced upon an indivudual. What's more, they claim that the church has no authority to enact taxes as a result! Indeed, the Church these radicals profess membership of is the Church Invisible, being the community of true believers in Christ and nothing more. This Church Invisible has no chapels, no bells, no altar. The only door is true faith and the only authority is God. While this radical doctrine is undoubtedly shunned by by every temporal power perhaps the common folk are right and the only authority that the land needs is God. As above in heaven as below on earth?"
